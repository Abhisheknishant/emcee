**The Python ensemble sampling toolkit for affine-invariant MCMC**

emcee is a stable, well tested Python implementation of the affine-invariant
ensemble sampler for Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
proposed by
[Goodman & Weare (2010)](http://cims.nyu.edu/~weare/papers/d13.pdf).
The code is open source and has
already been used in several published projects in the Astrophysics
literature.

emcee was developed by [Daniel Foreman-Mackey](http://danfm.ca) at
NYU with contributions from Dustin Lang.
