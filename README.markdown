##INTRODUCTION

MarkovPy is an extensible, pure-Python implementation of Markov chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) curve fitting. The calling syntax is designed to be
like scipy.optimize so that it can (almost) be a drop in replacement.

There are currently no plans to port the included ensemble sampler to
PyMC or any other platforms but such ports would (of course) be welcomed.


##INSTALLATION

Navigate to this directory and run

`% python setup.py install`

on the command line to install a module called pyest in the default
Python path.


##DEPENDENCIES

This package requires [NumPy](http://numpy.scipy.org/) and it has been
tested on Python 2.6.5.
