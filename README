INTRODUCTION

MarkovPy is an extensible, pure-Python implementation of Markov chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) curve fitting.


INSTALLATION

Navigate to this directory and run

% ./setup.py install

on the command line to install a module called markovpy in the default
Python path.


DEPENDENCIES

This package requires NumPy (http://numpy.scipy.org/) and it has been
tested on Python 2.6.5.


USAGE

The sample script "test.py" shows an example of a basic linear fitting
algorithm (following http://arxiv.org/abs/1008.4686 roughly).

markovpy.mcfit(loglike,bounds,args=None,sampler=None,proposal=None,N=1000)

loglike     -   a function loglike(params, *args) that returns the log-
                likelihood for parameters "params".

bounds      -   a (N,2) array with the hard bounds on the N-dimensional
                parameter space.

sampler     -   a markovpy.mcsampler object that performs the sampling
                the default sampler is a (fairly stupid) Metropolis-
                Hastings sampler with simulated annealing and iterative
                covariance recalculation.
                
                A more sophisticated sampler is also provided in
                markovpy.ensemble.EnsembleSampler(K) based on
                Goodman & Weare (2009) with K walkers.
